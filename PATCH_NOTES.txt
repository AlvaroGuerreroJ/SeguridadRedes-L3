Short summary:
- Added docker-compose.yml and two Flask apps (vulnapp on :5000, fixedapp on :5001).
- vulnapp demonstrates command injection (subprocess.getoutput with shell interpolation) and SQL injection (string-concatenated SQL).
- fixedapp applies simple mitigations: input whitelist + subprocess.run(list) and parameterized SQL queries.

Suggested commands to build and run the lab (run from project root):
```bash
docker-compose build
```
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Notes:
- Run only in an isolated environment (VM or private container network).
- To reinitialize a DB for either app, run: python vulnapp/init_db.py or python fixedapp/init_db.py
